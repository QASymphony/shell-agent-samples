# Automate Robot Framework through Jenkins

## Overview:

This guide illustrates how to upload results to qTest using Python Scripts. This will allow the user to upload Robot output.xml results. Also, the console output will be appended to your test runs in the attachement section. Place this folder on your Jenkins workspace directory as shown below:

## Set up Machine running Jenkins:

1) Install Python 3.6 from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2) Install Robot Framework from [https://pypi.org/project/robotframework/](https://pypi.org/project/robotframework/)

3) Install the Post Build Script Plugin, more information can be found at [https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/PostBuildScript+Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/PostBuildScript+Plugin)

### Tips for Set Up:

Windows:

Before running the automation host script ensure that all environmental variables are set up correctly, specifically that the PATH variable has been updated for Python and Robot.

Mac:

Use Homebrew to install Python and Robot. Steps for installing Homebrew can be found at [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh)

After installing Homebrew run this following command to get Python3:

`brew install python3`

Enter the following command to get Robot Framework

`brew install robot-framework`

**From Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows):**

1. Make sure pip was installed correctly with python on your machine by running the following command. It should output the pip version:

 `pip --version`

 Note: pip3 will work as well. Try `pip3 --version`

2. If pip is not installed, run the following command to install pip:

 `python -m -ensurepip --default-pip`

More information about downloading pip can be found at [https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)

3. After you have ensured pip is installed, run the following commands individually:

`pip install requests`

`pip install beautifulsoup4`

`pip install lxml`

`pip install pybase64`

Note: If using pip3 run commands with pip3 instead e.g. `pip3 install requests`

These commands will install the necessary modules required to run the python scripts. The modules are used to send requests to the API, and parse xml documents.

## Update Configuration File:

### qTest Manager Configuration file (conf.json)

**qtest\_api\_token:** The token used to authorize the connection to qTest Manager

**qtest\_url:** The personal url that is used to access QASymphony API

**project\_id:** The ID of the Project that the script will upload results to on qTest Manager

![](../../images/conf.png)

Open the conf.json file and update with your personal information. Enter your own qTest URL, API Token, and Project ID found in the qTest Manager Environment.

### Jenkins Configuration file (jenkinsconfig.json)

**JOBNAME:** Name of the specific jenkins job that you want to run from the configuration file

**JenkinsAPIToken:** Your Jenkins API token, found under the administration of your user in Jenkins.

![](../../images/jenkinsapitoken.png)

**JenkinsJobName:** The name of the Jenkins Job you want to trigger.

**JenkinsJobToken:** The Authentication Token you define for your job under Build Triggers.

![](../../images/jenkinsjobtoken.png)

**JenkinsURL:** The base URL of your Jenkins instance.

**JenkinsUserName:** The username with which you administer your Jenkins instance.

An example configuration file is shown below. In this example there are two job instances that could be called by the script

## Set Up Jenkins General Configuration:

For this example we will be pulling robot tests from BitBucket, which has a robot demo located at [https://bitbucket.org/robotframework/robotdemo/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/robotframework/robotdemo/src/master/). Place the url in the Jenkins Project configuration as shown below.

## Set up Jenkins Build Configuration

Note: If the Jenkins Job Name has spaces in it make sure to put the variable in quotes in the commands below. For example ${JOB_NAME} or %JOB_NAME% will be "${JOB_NAME}" or "%JOB_NAME%" respectively.

### For Mac Users (Use Execute shell):

 ![](../../images/buildscriptjenkinsrobotmac.PNG


### For Windows Users (Use Execute Windows batch command):

![](../../images/buildscriptjenkinsrobot.PNG)

## Set Up Jenkins Post Build Configuration:

1. Choose Execute Scripts and add a post build step

2. Keep the default values for "If build was" and "Execution is limited to" and click "Add build step"

### For Mac Users (Use Execute shell):

### For Windows Users (Use Execute Windows batch command):

### uploadQtest.py inputs

The inputs for the python script are:
1. "update" or "false" denoting whether an existing test-cycle will be updated
2. Name of Job in jenkinsconfig.json file so that credentials can be acquired for accessing Console Output.
 
## Running Automation:

This job can be run from Jenkins, but to trigger this Jenkins job from the Automation Host follow the guide in the triggerJenkins directory
